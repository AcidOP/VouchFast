# Introduction

This guide will help you get started with the basics of the VouchFast API.

First, learn about the basic terms used in the VouchFast API.

1. **List**: Lists are categorized testimonial collections.
   You can create separate lists for different types of testimonials.
   eg. `Customer Testimonials`, `Employee Testimonials`, etc.
2. **API Key**: An API key is a unique identifier that authenticates your requests to the VouchFast API.
   You need to include the API key in the request headers to authenticate your requests.

**API Base URL**: `https://api.vouchfast.com`

## API Auth

Every request must contain an `Api-Key` header with your API key.
Create an API key from the [VouchFast Dashboard](/dashboard/api-keys).
